# Schank's Goal-Based Scenarios

## The Scenario

You and Mr. Charles are Social Studies professors. Mr. Charles's students lack engagement with traditional lecture-based instruction about current events. As an advocate of Schank's case-based reasoning theory and goal-based scenarios (GBS), you've suggested this teaching method to him. Your task is to convince him to adopt GBS.

## Key Arguments for GBS

### Student Motivation and Active Learning

Goal-based scenarios transform students from passive recipients into active learners. Rather than absorbing pre-selected information, students investigate what they need to accomplish specific goals, creating intrinsic motivation through situational context. This approach produces engaged classrooms with students developing real-world skills applicable across varied contexts.

### Moving Beyond Facts

Traditional curriculum emphasizes reading about subjects rather than doing them. Schank argues that fact-focused instruction creates an illusion of knowledge without substance. GBS aims to provide "motivation, a sense of accomplishment, a support system, and a focus on skills rather than facts."

## Implementation Examples

Here are several GBS applications in Social Studies:

- **Community activism projects** — Students select local issues and conduct research before presenting findings at town hall meetings
- **Realistic scenarios** — News broadcast assignments where students investigate historical events like Gandhi's assassination
- **Mystery activities** — Questions such as "Was the Boston Massacre sentencing appropriate?" requiring primary source analysis
- **Provocative openings** — Classes begin with compelling questions leading to document-based inquiry

## Addressing Limitations

GBS works best when properly scaffolded, since long-term goals may seem disconnected from immediate coursework. However, having larger motivating objectives helps sustain engagement even through challenging intermediate material.
