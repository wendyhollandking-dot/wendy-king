# Gaming in the Classroom: EDrenaline Rush Book Review

This post reviews *EDrenaline Rush: Game-changing Student Engagement Inspired by Theme Parks, Mud Runs, and Escape Rooms* by John Meehan, which was assigned reading for a course on designing learning systems with simulation and game technology.

The book explores innovative approaches to making classroom learning more engaging and enjoyable. John Meehan draws inspiration from entertainment venues and experiential activities to transform educational experiences.

Meehan's work offers practical examples of how educators can incorporate game-like elements into instruction. His website (edrenalinerush.com) showcases various engaging activities successfully implemented in his own classroom.

The author includes a lot of examples of the types of engaging activities implemented in educational settings. A slideshow summary of the book's main concepts is available via Google Slides for those seeking a condensed overview.

Engaging with this material sparked nostalgia for my high school teaching days, suggesting the book's content resonates with educators seeking to enhance student motivation and participation through immersive, game-inspired learning experiences.
