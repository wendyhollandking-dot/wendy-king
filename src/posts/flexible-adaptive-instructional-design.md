# Flexible Adaptive Instructional Design and the STAR Legacy Software (Bransford)

This post examines how the STAR Legacy software model, developed by Bransford and colleagues, was applied in a lifespan development course where students created interactive learning objects using h5p.org.

## Course Implementation

### Assignment Structure

Students completed a challenge-based project involving four key phases:

1. **Introduction ("Why It Matters")**: Contextualized content on adolescence with learning outcomes and a pretest to activate prior knowledge
2. **Idea Generation**: Students pitched interactive concepts in a discussion forum, commenting on peers' ideas — aligning with the "generate ideas" stage of STAR
3. **Research Phase**: Students worked through module content and completed self-check quizzes offering formative feedback
4. **Creation & Publication**: Students built interactives and shared them in forums, with top submissions included in future course iterations ("Go Public" stage)

## Key Observations

**Making explicit connections between content and the assignment task** would have strengthened the design. Presenting the work as a problem to solve rather than a completion requirement would have enhanced motivation during the "look ahead" phase.

The "Go Public" component significantly increased project stakes and contributed substantially to the assignment's success.

## Recommendations for Modernization

The framework could be enhanced through:

- **Greater iterativity**: Incorporating low-stakes formative assessments at each workflow step
- **Scaffolding**: Allowing students to cycle through the process multiple times on smaller items before tackling larger assignments
- **Explicit reflection**: Emphasizing "progressive deepening" and returning to earlier stages
- **Reduced overwhelm**: Breaking complex projects into manageable components
