# Playing Catchup

It has been much too long since I've written here. The truth is, I've been deep in the work, and the work has been changing quickly!

After finishing my master's at UNC Charlotte, I returned to my work at Lumen with a renewed sense of purpose. I've always cared about building thoughtful, accessible, high-quality courseware and supporting students who need it the most instead of overwhelming them. But almost immediately after graduating, the ground shifted, and the tools I used to create said courseware changed dramatically.

It turns out I (maybe fortunately) graduated in the "last pre-AI class." I studied how to do instructional analysis the old-fashioned way, then just a few months later, ChatGPT arrived (I still remember showing it to my brother in awe over Thanksgiving break in 2022), and everything felt different.

Since then, I've been learning…a lot! Sure, I have my moments of concern that AI will take over my job (and the world!), but those moments of panic are infrequent, and usually, I'm on board with exploring the limits of what artificial intelligence can do. I work daily with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, using them all as valuable resources in helping me optimize my work and design.

I've spent the past few years figuring out what AI is actually good at in education, where it needs guardrails, and where human judgment is irreplaceable. I've become a student of prompt writing and feedback design, and I've experimented (sometimes awkwardly, sometimes successfully) with AI-assisted assignments and structured interactions.

In 2024, I taught an in-person Introduction to Psychology course at Davidson College, which reminded me how much I love testing ideas in a live classroom. It was so invigorating to teach again, and also humbling to again experience the demands of prepping, teaching, assessing, grading, and supporting student learners. Teaching with our own Lumen courseware, I identified deficits in our explanations and learned more about what instructors really want and need to facilitate student growth.

I led the migration of our entire Psychology catalog into Lumen One. That includes Introduction to Psychology, Psychopathology (Abnormal Psychology), and Lifespan Development. That work required rethinking not just content, but architecture: how courses are structured, how activities are sequenced, and how students practice applying what they learn.

At the same time, I helped revamp Sociology and began building out our U.S. History catalog. Lumen One courses emphasize application much more heavily than our previous versions. Each module now includes "Apply It" activities and classroom-ready Instructor Guide materials, so I loved the challenge of developing content, assessments, interactives, and scenarios to fulfill this new need.

I worked in H5P, Oppia, Twine, Lumen Ohm, and more recently, experimented with Claude Code to build branching scenarios, structured practice tools, and interactive activities. Some projects were polished. Some were scrappy prototypes. All of them were attempts to move students from passive reading to active thinking.

What I've realized over the past few years is that I'm less interested in "content creation" and more interested in building learning systems — those experiences where students make decisions, get feedback, revise their thinking, and try again.

AI has changed the texture of the work. At times, it can feel repetitive (there is only so much copying and pasting one person should do!). But more recently, the work feels more creative, though also more technical. It's iterative and expansive, and I often feel like there's no limit to what I could build. The real challenge now is focus: choosing what students truly need and ensuring that the things I create are aligned with what is actually needed and what will actually move learning forward.

There is still so much to learn, and I'm here for it. Just last week, I had AI help me design a personal learning plan to deepen my technical skills — strengthening my understanding of JavaScript, Python, CSS, and how to build more confidently within GitHub.

And I'm excited about where this next stretch of work is heading. Since I'm learning so much, I thought I'd be better about sharing some more of the process along the way.

Stay tuned!
