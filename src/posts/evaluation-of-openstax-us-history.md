# Evaluation of OpenStax US History

For my 6101 Learning Principles in Learning, Design and Technology class, I completed a final assignment evaluating online learning materials through the lens of established learning theories.

The evaluation examines OpenStax U.S. History by applying two theoretical frameworks:

1. **Merrill's First Principles of Instruction** — An evidence-based approach to instructional design
2. **Schank's Goal-Based Learning** — A model emphasizing learning through goal-directed scenarios

The detailed analysis is available in [a Google Docs paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/156Vw0ZNNBvOaCoPf0HXbg9-2_zRLP7h05YKUksc9ffE/edit) that applies these theoretical frameworks to evaluate the OpenStax resource's effectiveness as an online learning tool.
