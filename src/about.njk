    <h1>I've always believed <em>learning is cool.</em></h1>
    <p>The only decoration I remember from my 10th grade history classroom was a bulletin board covered in big, bright letters: <em>"Learning is Cool!"</em> It sounds simple — maybe even a little cheesy — but it's stuck with me through every chapter of my career. Through a decade in the classroom, into online course design, and now into AI-informed learning systems, that conviction has never wavered. Learning is cool. And thinking carefully about how it happens best? Even cooler.</p>

        <h2>15+ years of building learning that <em>sticks.</em></h2>
        <p class="body-text">I started my career as a high school teacher in Provo, Utah — teaching AP Psychology, AP World History, Geography, and U.S. History. I loved the classroom, but I was even more fascinated by the design behind it: why some lessons landed and others didn't, why some assessments revealed real understanding while others just measured memorization.</p>
        <p class="body-text">That curiosity led me into online learning. I designed and taught an OER-based Introduction to Psychology course for the Utah Education Network, then joined Lumen Learning in 2014 — where I've spent the last decade architecting high-enrollment digital courseware across psychology, sociology, economics, history, and more.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In 2024, I returned to the classroom as an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at Davidson College — designing and delivering a flipped, application-based Intro Psych course. Teaching my own product in a live environment was one of the most valuable things I've ever done as a designer.</p>

      <div>
        <div class="section-eyebrow">My Philosophy</div>
        <h2>The best offense is a <em>good defense.</em></h2>
        <p class="body-text">I come to every project prepared. That means doing the research before the design, understanding the learner before writing the objectives, and anticipating the edge cases before launch. Preparation isn't caution — it's what makes bold design possible.</p>
        <p class="body-text">At the same time, I've learned that the best-prepared designers are also the best at pivoting. Learner data, SME feedback, classroom reality — these things reshape every project. I stay ready to adapt without losing the thread of what the learning needs to do.</p>
        <p class="body-text">I believe in accessible education for everyone. I've built my career on Open Educational Resources because high-quality learning shouldn't be a privilege. That conviction shapes every design decision I make.</p>

<!-- APPROACH -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="section-inner">
    <div class="section-eyebrow">My Approach</div>
    <h2>I design like an architect and iterate like a <em>teacher.</em></h2>
    <p class="body-text">Every learning product I build starts with the same question: what should a learner be able to do that they couldn't do before? From there, I work backward — identifying the knowledge, skills, and practice opportunities needed to get there.</p>
    <div class="approach-grid">
      <div class="approach-card">
        <h4>Evidence-Based Design</h4>
        <p>My process integrates ADDIE and backward design with cognitive load theory, spaced practice, and retrieval-based learning. Good design isn't intuitive — it's a craft grounded in research.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="approach-card">
        <h4>AI as Accelerator</h4>
        <p>I use AI to speed up assessment iteration, content modernization, gap analysis, and scalable revision cycles — while keeping evidence-based pedagogy at the center. AI speeds the work. Principles determine what's worth building.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="approach-card">
        <h4>Built for Real Learners</h4>
        <p>I don't design for the ideal learner. I design for the full range — diverse backgrounds, varied preparation, real constraints. Accessibility and scalability aren't afterthoughts; they're design requirements.</p>

<!-- LOOKING FOR -->
<div class="looking-for" id="contact">
  <h2>Let's build something that <em>performs.</em></h2>
  <p>I'm currently open to senior instructional design roles, learning systems consulting, and freelance course development engagements. I'm particularly interested in organizations where design decisions are grounded in evidence, outcomes are measurable, and there's appetite for innovation.</p>
